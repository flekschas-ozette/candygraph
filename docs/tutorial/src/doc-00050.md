## Installation and Initialization

First, install CandyGraph:

```
npm i --save candygraph
```

Then import it and create an instance. Here we'll also size the context's
backing canvas to be large enough for all our later examples. Note that the
canvas element has not been added to the DOM. If you wish to display it
directly, that's fine (there's reason to in many cases!), but you'll need to add
it to the DOM yourself, it's not automatic.

```ts
import { createCandyGraph } from "candygraph";

async function main() {
  const cg = await createCandyGraph();
  cg.canvas.width = 1024;
  cg.canvas.height = 1024;
}

main();
```
